# YouTube Automation Agent

> **Windows desktop edition:** this repository now includes **CreatorPilot**, an installable BYO-key desktop app with encrypted local settings, Cheaper Inference text/image generation, AI33 Pro TTS/STT support, browser-based YouTube OAuth, and per-user application data. See [DESKTOP_GUIDE.md](DESKTOP_GUIDE.md), run `npm run desktop` for development, or `npm run dist:win` to build the installer.

## What's New in v2.4

- **Guided walkthrough for first-time setup** — `npm run walkthrough` (also offered when you run `npm run setup`). It explains every choice in plain English, shows exactly where to get each key (and opens the page in your browser), **live-tests keys the moment you paste them**, walks you click-by-click through Google Cloud for the YouTube connection, and signs you in via your browser instead of copy-pasting auth codes. Every step is skippable and progress is saved — re-run it any time.
- **`.env` files actually work now** — `dotenv` was a dependency but was never loaded, so `.env` settings (API keys, `API_KEY`, `FFMPEG_PATH`…) were silently ignored unless exported in your shell. `index.js` and the setup tools now load `.env` on start.
- **`.env.example` no longer poisons setup** — the uncommented `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here` placeholder would have been picked up as a real key; all placeholders are now commented out.
- **Browser OAuth opens automatically** — the YouTube authorization URL now opens in your default browser.

## What's New in v2.3

- **Full free-tier pipeline with Gemini** — image generation (`gemini-3.1-flash-image`) and native voice narration (`gemini-3.1-flash-tts-preview`) now run on your Gemini key. A Gemini-only setup produces complete narrated videos end to end; OpenAI/ElevenLabs are used first when configured. Models and voice are configurable via `GEMINI_IMAGE_MODEL`, `GEMINI_TTS_MODEL`, `GEMINI_TTS_VOICE`. (Thanks to PR #6 for demonstrating the demand and fallback-chain direction.)
- **~50× faster slideshow rendering** — instead of screenshotting a headless browser at 30fps (~10 minutes for a 30-second video), the renderer captures one still per slide and lets FFmpeg build the video with crossfades (seconds).
- **No more junk template topics** — template mode (no AI key) previously scraped single keywords from trending titles and produced videos like "crown: The Complete Guide". It now uses a curated evergreen topic list and only accepts trending topics that read like real subjects.
- **Model catalog corrections** — replaced the nonexistent `gemini-3.5-pro` picker entry with `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` / `gemini-2.5-pro` (verified against Google's current model list).

## What's New in v2.2

This release resolves every open GitHub issue (#1, #2, #3, #4, #8, #9, #13):

- **Gemini (and every other provider) now passes credential validation** — startup and setup no longer demand an OpenAI key. Any one configured AI provider (OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter, Kimi, MiMo, or GLM) is enough. (#3, #9)
- **FFmpeg is bundled** — `npm install` now pulls a prebuilt FFmpeg binary via `ffmpeg-static`, so `'ffmpeg' is not recognized` is gone. A system install on your PATH or `FFMPEG_PATH` in `.env` still takes precedence. (#1)
- **Generated content actually reaches the publish queue** — the `/generate` pipeline previously produced a video and then never scheduled it, so "Processing publish queue" ran forever with nothing to do. It now queues every successful production. (#2)
- **Real .mp4 output without paid keys** — if TTS isn't configured, the slideshow renders as a silent video instead of dying on a placeholder file. Placeholder `.info` assets are filtered out of slides. (#4)
- **No more silent failures** — a capability check at startup shows exactly which pipeline stages will run for real (✓) vs. what's missing and how to fix it (✗). Productions that only produced placeholders are marked `simulated`, are never scheduled for upload, and log a loud warning. (#4, #8, #13)
- **Setup wizard no longer hard-aborts** — missing credentials or FFmpeg produce warnings with fix instructions instead of `❌ Setup failed!`. (#9)
- **Publish-queue logging is informative** — shows how many items are waiting and when the next publish happens, instead of an identical line every 15 minutes. (#2)

## What's New in v2.1

- **Real AI generation wired in** — the Content Strategy, Script Writer, and SEO agents now call your configured AI provider (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Kimi, MiMo, GLM, or Gemini) for topics, scripts, titles, descriptions, and tags. If no provider key is set, they fall back to the built-in templates so the pipeline still runs.
- **API protection** — set `API_KEY` in `.env` and the mutating endpoints (`POST /generate`, `POST /publish/:id`) require a matching `x-api-key` header. Request bodies are validated and size-limited.
- **Safer publishing** — default privacy is now `private` (set `DEFAULT_PRIVACY_STATUS=public` to opt in), and the uploader streams the real video file — it refuses to upload placeholder assets from simulated runs.
- **Startup and scheduler fixes** — added the missing `sharp` dependency (the app previously crashed on boot), created the missing `automation_events` table (every scheduled task previously threw on logging), fixed the double-insert in the content pipeline, and fixed the publish-queue removal.
- **No more fabricated statistics** — template scripts no longer invent numbers like "90% of people…".
- **Cleaner repo** — removed two dead OAuth flows (`authenticate.js`, `simple-auth.js` used Google's long-deprecated OOB flow), dead dependencies (`cron`, `jimp`), broken npm scripts, and committed build artifacts. Added ESLint (`npm run lint`) and GitHub Actions CI.

## What's New in v2.0

- **Model upgrades across the board** — GPT-5.5 / GPT-5.5 Instant replace GPT-4-turbo, GPT Image 2 replaces DALL-E 3, Gemini 3.5 Flash/Pro replace Gemini 1.x, ElevenLabs Eleven v3 replaces v1, Wan 2.7 replaces Stable Video Diffusion
- **OpenAI SDK v6** — upgraded from v4, along with `@google/genai` v2.9, `replicate` v1.4, `googleapis` v173
- **Revamped setup wizard** — new TTS service picker (OpenAI TTS / ElevenLabs / Azure), ElevenLabs credential setup, updated model selection menus
- **Fixed deprecated API patterns** — OpenAI v3 SDK calls in credential testing replaced with v4+ patterns
- **Dynamic year in content strategy** — no more hardcoded "2025" in trend analysis prompts
- **README rewrite** — developer-focused docs with Mermaid architecture diagrams, no fluff

    C --> E[Production Management Agent]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Publishing & Scheduling Agent]
    F --> G[Analytics & Optimization Agent]
    G -->|feedback loop| A
```

## How It Works

Each agent handles one stage of the pipeline:

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Content Strategy** | Analyzes YouTube trends, identifies topics, plans content calendar |
| **Script Writer** | Generates scripts with hooks, storytelling, CTAs |
| **Thumbnail Designer** | Creates thumbnails, runs A/B variations |
| **SEO Optimizer** | Keywords, titles, descriptions, tags |
| **Production** | Coordinates TTS audio, image assets, video assembly |
| **Publishing** | Uploads, schedules, manages playlists |
| **Analytics** | Tracks performance, feeds insights back to strategy |

## AI Providers

All OpenAI-compatible providers work out of the box — the system auto-configures the SDK base URL. Pick one, or use OpenRouter to access everything through a single key.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Direct
        OA[OpenAI<br/>GPT-5.5]
        GM[Gemini<br/>3.5 Flash/Pro]
        KM[Kimi<br/>K2.6]
        MM[MiMo<br/>V2.5 Pro]
        GL[GLM<br/>GLM-5]
    end
    subgraph Router
        OR[OpenRouter<br/>300+ models]
    end
    Direct --> YAA[YouTube Automation Agent]
    Router --> YAA
```

| Provider | Models | Base URL | Cost |
|----------|--------|----------|------|
| **OpenAI** | GPT-5.5, GPT-5.5 Instant | `api.openai.com/v1` | ~$0.05–0.20/video |
| **OpenRouter** | 300+ (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Kimi, GLM, etc.) | `openrouter.ai/api/v1` | varies by model |
| **Google Gemini** | Gemini 3.5 Flash, 3.5 Pro | via `@google/genai` SDK | free tier available |
| **Kimi (Moonshot AI)** | Kimi K2.6, K2.5 | `api.moonshot.ai/v1` | ~80% cheaper than GPT-5.5 |
| **MiMo (Xiaomi)** | MiMo V2.5 Pro, V2.5 | `api.xiaomimimo.com/v1` | competitive |
| **GLM (Zhipu AI)** | GLM-5, GLM-5.1 | `api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/` | ~$1/M input tokens |

Additional integrations: Anthropic Claude (`claude-opus-4-8`), ElevenLabs (Eleven v3 TTS), Replicate (Wan 2.7 video), local models via Ollama, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/darkzOGx/youtube-automation-agent.git
cd youtube-automation-agent
npm install
npm run walkthrough   # guided first-time setup: explains everything, tests your keys live
npm start
```

Dashboard runs at `http://localhost:3456`.

Already know what you're doing? `npm run setup` offers a classic quick mode, and `.env.example` documents every setting.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- FFmpeg — bundled automatically via `ffmpeg-static` on `npm install`; a system install on your PATH or an `FFMPEG_PATH` env var takes precedence
- Google account (YouTube Data API — free)
- At least one AI provider key (OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter, Kimi, MiMo, or GLM) — without one, agents fall back to template-based generation
- Images and narration come from your AI key: OpenAI **or Gemini** both cover image generation and TTS (ElevenLabs / Azure Speech optional for premium voices) — with no media provider at all you get gradient slides and silent video

## Configuration

### API Keys

#### YouTube Data API (required, free)

1. Create a project in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Enable **YouTube Data API v3**
3. Create an OAuth 2.0 client (Desktop app)
4. Save the JSON as `config/credentials.json`

#### OpenAI

1. Get a key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`

#### OpenRouter (easiest — one key, all models)

1. Get a key from [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
2. Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.env`

#### Google Gemini

1. Get a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`

#### Kimi / MiMo / GLM

| Provider | Get key at | Env var |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Kimi (Moonshot AI) | [platform.kimi.ai](https://platform.kimi.ai) | `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` |
| MiMo (Xiaomi) | [mimo.mi.com](https://mimo.mi.com) | `MIMO_API_KEY` |
| GLM (Zhipu AI) | [z.ai](https://z.ai) | `GLM_API_KEY` |

### Environment Variables

```env
# AI provider — pick one (or use OpenRouter for access to all)

# Optional: protect mutating API routes (POST /generate, /publish)
# API_KEY=some-long-random-string
```

## Automation Schedule

```mermaid
gantt
    title Daily Pipeline
    dateFormat HH:mm
    axisFormat %H:%M

    section Content
    Generate content (strategy + script + thumbnail + SEO) :06:00, 2h

    section Publishing
    Process publishing queue :crit, 08:00, 14h

    section Analytics
    Collect analytics     :09:00, 1h
    Run optimizations     :22:00, 1h
```

The scheduler runs automatically after `npm start`. Content generation at 06:00, publishing queue processed every 15 minutes, analytics at 09:00, optimization at 22:00. Weekly strategy reviews run on Sundays.

## API

```bash
# health check
curl http://localhost:3456/health

# generate a video on demand (send x-api-key if API_KEY is set in .env)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3456/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"topic": "Top 10 Life Hacks", "style": "list"}'

# view schedule
curl http://localhost:3456/schedule

# get analytics
curl http://localhost:3456/analytics

# publish a specific content item
curl -X POST http://localhost:3456/publish/:contentId
```

## Production Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph TTS["Audio Generation"]
        direction TB
        EL[ElevenLabs v3] -.->|fallback| OA[OpenAI TTS]
        OA -.->|fallback| SIM1[Simulation]
    end

    subgraph IMG["Image Generation"]
        direction TB
        GPT[GPT Image 2] -.->|fallback| SIM2[Simulation]
    end

    subgraph VID["Video Assembly"]
        direction TB
        WAN[Wan 2.7 I2V] -.->|fallback| PW[Playwright Slideshow]
        PW -.->|fallback| SIM3[Simulation]
    end

    TTS --> MIX[FFmpeg Mux]
    IMG --> VID
    VID --> MIX
    MIX --> OUT[Final Video]
```

Each stage has graceful fallbacks. If a paid API key isn't configured, the system simulates that step so the rest of the pipeline still runs.

## Extending

### Custom AI provider

```javascript
// utils/ai-service.js
const Anthropic = require('@anthropic-ai/sdk');

class ClaudeAIService {
  constructor(apiKey) {
    this.client = new Anthropic({ apiKey });
  }
  async generateContent(prompt) {
    const message = await this.client.messages.create({
      model: 'claude-opus-4-8',
      max_tokens: 1024,
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }]
    });
    return message.content[0].text;
  }
}
```

### Custom content types

```javascript
// agents/content-strategy-agent.js
const contentTypes = {
  'podcast': {
    duration: '10-15 minutes',
    style: 'conversational',
    thumbnail: 'podcast-style'
  },
};
```

├── agents/          # one file per agent
├── config/          # credentials, example configs

```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `Missing credentials for: an AI provider` | Configure any one provider with `npm run credentials:setup` — OpenAI is not required |
| `'ffmpeg' is not recognized` / no .mp4 produced | Run `npm install` (fetches the bundled binary), or install FFmpeg and set `FFMPEG_PATH` |
| Video marked `simulated`, nothing uploads | Check the ✗ lines in the startup capability check — a key or FFmpeg is missing |
| "Processing publish queue" but nothing publishes | The queue log now shows what's waiting; content publishes at its scheduled time (default: next day 2 PM) |
| YouTube API quota exceeded | Check quotas in Google Cloud Console; reduce posting frequency |
| Content generation failed | Verify API keys and credits; check `logs/` |
| Publishing failed | Re-authenticate YouTube OAuth tokens; check video format |

Enable debug logging:

```bash
NODE_ENV=development DEBUG_MODE=true npm start
```
